# Serverboss (but old)
These are the old denizen sources for Serverboss. They are most likely out of date, missing user scripts, and broken. You are granted no particular rights to this code, but we dont care if you steal it.

These sources are meant for denizen 1.16.5. It will perform badly on 1.17 and not work at all on later versions. Prepare for the worst affronts to God to be found in these sources. You will need a good computer to run this.

These sources have been uploaded in the hope that they will be useful for anyone in reimplementing Serverboss. The original Serverboss team is currently working on a fabric mod, available [here](https://github.com/ice-nuclearcrackhead239/serverboss).

Additionally, the resource pack has not been included. Ask Ice for it if you need it.
